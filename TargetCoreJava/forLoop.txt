Q5. In a for loop, and can be statements more complicated than declaring, initializing, and updating a loop-control variable. How can I take advantage of this ability?

The for statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values.If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.
Syntax of simple for loop :
for(initialization;termination;increment)
{
statements(s);
}

1.Intialization expression intialize the loop;it is executed onces, as the loop begins
2.When the termination expression evaluates to false the loop terminates.
3.The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop.it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment or decrement a value.

Example:
	class ForDemo
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			for(int i=1;i<11;i++){
				System.out.println("count is:" +i);
			}
		}
	}

apart from this we can use break and continue statement .
Break statement:
 this statement is used to jump out of a loop when a certain condition is met.
ex:The example jumps out of the loop when the value of i is equal to 4.
    public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i == 4) {
                break;
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
    }

continue statement:The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs,
and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
ex:This example skips the value of 4.
    public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            if (i == 4) {
                continue;
             }
           System.out.println(i);
          }
    }
    }
