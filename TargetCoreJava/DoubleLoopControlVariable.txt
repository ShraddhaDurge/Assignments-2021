Q6 Can I use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop
It is fine to use a double variable as a loop-control variable, especially if you want to loop through fractional values or increment by fractional values.However it is advisable not to use "==" to compare for the condition to end the loop. Due to precision errors this can easily result in an infinite loop in spite of the best intentions. That's why we need to use "<=".It's not a good idea to use floating point values as for-loop variables because of subtleties in arithmetic and comparison.for loop might not iterate through the values you expect because of rounding errors.
